# Articles

A Vanilla Forums application that provides a way to create articles.

This application is released under the GNU GPL2 license.

## Features

Too many times have we seen posts about embedding, integrating, and unifying Vanilla with bloated blogging software. Current blogging addons modify discussions into blog posts. However, blog posts and discussions are completely different things.

- Article workflow consisting of draft, pending review, and published article states and based on permissions.
- Comments with threading for replies to the top-level comment.
- Guest commenting which is switchable globally with moderation and spam checks.
- File upload for article thumbnail and images.
- Top-level categories.
- Simple and clean presentation of articles.
- Stability and performance is of importance, and Vanilla 2.3+ is the target for compatibility.

The word "article" stands for content produced by both bloggers and journalists, and is interchangeable with "blog post."

## Installation

*This add-on is an application, not a plugin.

**Steps to install:**
1. Extract this download to your Vanilla installation's `/applications` folder. It should have a folder named `articles` inside of it now.
2. Enable the Articles application via the "Applications" page in your Vanilla's dashboard.

## Upgrading

*If you're upgrading to Articles 1.2.0 from an older version and have modified the role permissions related to Articles, you must reconfigure your permissions since global permissions have been replaced with category-based permissions.

**Steps to upgrade:**
1. Extract this download to your Vanilla installation's `/applications` folder. Overwrite old application files.
2. Go to the "Applications" page in your Vanilla's dashboard and then disable and re-enable the Articles application for updates to apply.
